sources
	examples
		wind varies over time with wind, no inertia
		solar varies over time with sun and clouds, no inertia
		nuclear high power, slow to change power
		hydro has limited reservoir
		diesel generator can cold start
	dimensions
		variability
		cold start
		power
		ramp
		fuel availability
		inertia
when load changes, energy is taken from the inertia of the grid
governors are responsible for keeping the inertia such that the whole thing goes at 60Hz
when power station is producing much more than grid requires, generator goes asynchronous - no power to grid, all power to heat => explosion
when power grid is producing much more than required, all generators speed up until one explodes
